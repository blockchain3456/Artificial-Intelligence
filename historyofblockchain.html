           The first design of blockchain appeared in 1991 by Stuart Harber and W. Scott Scornetta. 
          In 1992, they made their design more efficient. However, the first blockchain database appeared 
          in 2008, produced by Satoshi Nakamoto. We still do not know who/what Satoshi Nakamoto is or was. However, 
          their invention led to the rise and common usage of bitcoin.

           The first open source Bitcoin client was released in 2009. Satoshi Nakamoto managed to get over one million
           bitcoins before disappearing in 2010. Today, the value of their bitcoin fortune, which remains untouched, is worth $4 billion. 
           In April 2010, BitcoinMarket.com opens, where online purchase of Bitcoin happens for the first time. In May 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz makes a purchase for the first time with Bitcoin, buying two pizzas for 10,000 bitcoin. In May 2011, Bitpay is founded. By October 2013, more than 1000 people are using Bitcoin.

           Bitcoin does have a history of bubbles. The first one was May-July 2011, the second was in April 2013, where it went from $250 to $100 after the bubble burst. In July and December, Dell and Microsoft that accepting Bitcoin payments respectively. By August 2016, around 160,000 people were using bitcoin were transactions.

          Recently, Bitcoin has seen a huge surge in price, eclipising $10,000 in 2017. However, there are concerns that this is a bubble. Many experts think this is the result of non-specialists getting involved in the 'hype' around Bitcoin, in a similar fashion to the Dotcom bubble (which burst in the early 2000s), which results in a panic to invest, followed by the bubble 'bursting' (which leads to a sharp fall in price). Others believe that it is the result of Bitcoin going 'mainstream' and entering the class of other commonly used currencies, and that its recent rise in value is a trend we can expect for the future.
