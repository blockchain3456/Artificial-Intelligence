     The first design of blockchain appeared in 1991 by Stuart Harber and W. Scott Scornetta. 
     In 1992, they made their design more efficient. However, the first blockchain database appeared 
     in 2008, produced by Satoshi Nakamoto. We still do not know who/what Satoshi Nakamoto is or was. However, 
     their invention led to the rise and common usage of bitcoin.

  	bitcoins before disappearing in 2010. Today, the value of their bitcoin fortune, which remains untouched, is worth $4 billion.

  	Recently, Bitcoin has seen a huge surge in price, eclipising $10,000 in 2017. However, there are concerns that this is a bubble. Many experts think this is the result of non-specialists getting involved in the 'hype' around Bitcoin, in a similar fashion to the Dotcom bubble, which results in a panic to invest. Others believe that it is the result of Bitcoin going 'mainstream' and entering the class of other commonly used currencies.
