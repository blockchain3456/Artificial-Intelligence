    	<p> Described as an  <blockquote class="blockquote-reverse"> 
    		<p>"open, distributed ledger, that can record transactions by two parties in an efficient way" </p> <footer> by Harvard Business Review, blockchain was first invented in 2008.</footer> 
    		</blockquote>
    	Its invention allowed the first ever digital currency-Bitcoin- to be distributed. It has many uses, especially in the financial and legal sector. </p>

    	<h2> How does it work? </h2>
    <p> Blockchain is a database, containing a ledger which records transactions which can be approved by others in the network. A new block is added to the chain with each subsequent transaction, leaving a permanent record of the transaction and the ability of everyone in the network to see the transaction. 
    	<ul> There are three specific types of Blockchain: 
    	<li> Centralised: which are based on a single point of management, with the leader there to unify the group. This provides a balanced trade off between freedom and security and efficiency.</li>
    	<li> Decentralised: these systems are not based around a hierarchy, and is centrally managed by a trustless interaction protocol.</li> 
    	<li> Distributed: in this, each Node is a copy of the original, sometimes identical but usually with minor to moderate differences. Each entity can interact with one another, but act independently. </li>
    	There are different levels of control within blockchain- a permisionless network is an open network that anybody can access, meaning anyone can make and validate a transaction. 
        </ul> 
    </p>
        <h2> Why use a blockchain? </h2>
    <p> Blockchain can fit into current systems easily, with transactions occuring instantaneously and always up to date. All information is held securely and transactions themselves are not modifiable, making all of the transactions visible. </p>
